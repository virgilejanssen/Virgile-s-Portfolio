#Virgile's Portfolio
**Wordpress Theme** / Version: 1.0

##Author
**Virgile Janssen** (virgilejanssen.com)
##Summary
A responsive CSS3 and HTML5 portfolio theme, for showcasing your photography, art, web sites, or other projects.

I initially developed this theme for my personal portfolio (graphic design projects), so even though I made some changes and tried to integrate as many wordpress functionality as possible, it’s still misses some functionality and doesn’t pass the theme check yet.
 
Anyone is welcome to download it, use it or contribute !

##Install
You can check worpdress install instructions [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes)
###Menus
Go to **Appearance -> Menus** panel in your site admin, create your menu and be sure to check *Primary Menu* in the Menu Settings.
###Posts
You can check wordpress page about writing posts [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts).

Add the image you want to display on the home page as a *Featured Image*.

Upload the images or iframes link in the *Body Copy Box*.

If you want to add a description and/or metadata you'll need to create custom fields. 
Scroll down to the area titled Custom Fields.

**Note:** As of WordPress version 3.1, some [screen options](http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Screen_Options) on the Post & Page edit Administration Panels are hidden by default. Custom Fields are hidden by default if they have not been used before.

Create a new custom field for each metadata (i.e : year, website, link, ...). If you want to display a longer text, such as a descritption, create a custom field with the key *description* (lowercases).
